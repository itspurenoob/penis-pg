 🚨 WARNING: THIS CODE IS A MISTAKE 🚨
 =======================================================================

 Welcome, weary traveler. You have stumbled upon the **most cursed**
 segment of this entire project. If you are reading this, it is already 
 too late. You are now legally obligated to continue suffering.

 ⚠️ DISCLAIMER ⚠️
 - This code contains **zero** optimization.
 - It was written in a caffeine-induced **rage**.
 - If you attempt to refactor it, **something WILL break**.
 - This function is **held together by pure desperation and duct tape**.

 🛑 THINGS THIS CODE HATES: 🛑
 - Proper memory management
 - Error handling
 - Your sanity
 - Your will to live
 - The **concept of decency**
 - That one dude who keeps using `std::endl` instead of `\n`
 - The word "segs" (if you know, you know)
 - People who put pineapple on pizza

 🙏 LAST WORDS BEFORE YOU DEBUG 🙏
 If you find yourself debugging this code at 3 AM, 
 questioning your life choices, just know this:
 **You were never supposed to see this.**
 **This function was meant to be forgotten, buried in history.**
 **Yet, here you are, staring into the abyss.**
 **And the abyss stares back.**

 TL;DR:
 Do not touch. Do not refactor. Do not ask questions.
 Just accept that this code works (somehow) and **move on.**

 P.S. If you uncomment the wrong line, **you void your warranty on life.**
