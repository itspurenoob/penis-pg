ðŸ”¥ **CODE OF CONDUCT: PAIN EDITION** ðŸ”¥

----------

**Welcome, brave soul.** You have entered the **realm of suffering.** This project is not designed for productivity, efficiency, or sanity. Instead, it exists to:

-   **Torture ourselves.**
-   **Torture anyone trying to compile it.**
-   **Torture even the compiler itself.**

By contributing to this **masterpiece of agony,** you agree to follow these **sacred laws of suffering.**

----------

### **RULE 1: NO CLEAN CODE**

-   If your code looks too **readable**, **refactor it into unreadable spaghetti.**
-   If you use **comments**, make sure they are **misleading** or **existential crises.**
    -   Example:

        `// This should never work, but it does. Why?` 
        
-   Function names should have **no relation to their functionality.**
    -   Example: A function that generates text might be called `explode_the_memory_leak()`.

----------

### **RULE 2: INEFFICIENCY IS KEY**

-   If there's a **faster** way to do something, **avoid it at all costs.**
-   We **DO NOT** use databases. Instead, **we store everything in RAM** until the system begs for mercy.
-   **Load the entire dictionary** into memory, even if you only need one word.
-   **Never cache anything.**
-   **Recompute the same values every single time they are needed.**

----------

### **RULE 3: CROSS-PLATFORM PAIN**

-   This must **work on every OS** but **make compiling it absolute hell.**
-   Use dependencies that are **platform-specific** and force users to fix them manually.
-   **If something compiles too easily, add another dependency that breaks on a random OS.**

----------

### **RULE 4: MAKE THE COMPILER CRY**

-   Use **as many warnings as possible.**
-   If the compiler fixes something automatically, **undo the fix manually.**
-   Abuse unsafe code **even when it's unnecessary.**
-   If Clippy suggests something, **do the opposite.**
-   Write functions that take **30+ parameters** just to pass one value.

----------

### **RULE 5: DOCUMENTATION IS FOR THE WEAK**

-   If you document, make it **philosophical** instead of useful.
    -   Example:
        
        
        `/// This function seeks the truth in an endless void.  fn  add_numbers(a: i32, b: i32) ->  i32 {
            a + b
        }` 
        
-   Make sure **function signatures lie** about what they do.

----------

### **RULE 6: ERROR HANDLING IS OPTIONAL**

-   **Panic instead of handling errors.**
-   If you must handle an error, **log it in the most cryptic way possible.**
    -   Example:
        
        `eprintln!("The void has whispered back. It does not approve.");` 
        
-   **Use unwrap() everywhere.**

----------

### **RULE 7: THE README SHOULD TERRIFY PEOPLE**

-   The README must make **potential users question their life choices.**
-   Instead of explaining how to use the project, **explain why using it is a mistake.**

----------

**By contributing to this project, you acknowledge that sanity is a distant memory.**
