# **💀 WELCOME TO PENIS-PG 💀**

_"If you're reading this, it's already too late."_

## **WTF IS THIS?**

Penis-PG (**Procedural Epileptic Neuro-Intelligent Shit-Phonk Generator**) is a project that **NEVER** should have been made.

🔥 It’s **not optimized.**  
🔥 It’s **not efficient.**  
🔥 It’s **held together with duct tape, desperation, and divine intervention.**

### **What does it do?**

It **procedurally generates** lyrics that sound like a fever dream, slaps them onto **TTS voices that should not exist**, drowns everything in **distorted reverb**, and then forces **AI-generated phonk beats** underneath.

### **The result?**

-   A bass-boosted **abomination**.
-   A **sonic war crime**.
-   Something **so cursed** that your **ears will file a restraining order.**

This ain't music.  
This is **revenge against the concept of sound itself.**

----------

## **HOW DOES IT WORK?**

💀 **Rust** – The **mastermind of destruction.**

-   Generates **AI-generated lyrics** that make zero sense.
-   Uses **TTS voices that sound like they’re possessed.**
-   Adds **audio filters straight from the underworld.**

🔥 **C++** – The **accomplice in crime.**

-   Procedurally generates **phonk beats on crack.**
-   **808s that will blow your speakers and your will to live.**
-   Randomized **rhythms that make no musical sense.**

⚠️ **Rust & C++ Interop** – A **toxic relationship.**

-   Held together by **FFI, spit, and suffering.**
-   One wrong semicolon and the **whole project dies instantly.**

----------

## **SO LET ME TELL YOU HOW C++ AND RUST F💀CK TOGETHER**

-   **Rust creates a function.**
-   That function gets compiled as an **OS-level** `.lib` or `.a` file.
-   Now, it's a **raw system-level artifact** with **no loyalty to Rust.**
-   C++ comes along and says, **"Yo OS, gimme that function."**
-   OS: **"Take it, IDGAF."**
-   Now C++ **steals** Rust’s work like a **deadbeat dad claiming his son’s science project.**

One wrong move and this **house of cards collapses.** Rust screams **"safety!"** while C++ raw-dogs the memory stack like it’s 1995.

## **⚠️ WARNING ⚠️**

Running this software may result in:

❌ **Hearing loss** (Your ears will never forgive you.)  
❌ **Existential crisis** (You’ll regret every decision that led you here.)  
❌ **Compiler breakdown** (Even the best compilers **cry sometimes.**)  
❌ **Phonk gods cursing you** (They didn’t ask for this.)  
❌ **Your PC trying to escape** (If it had legs, it’d be gone.)  
❌ **Your TTS voice developing an attitude** (One day, it will refuse to speak.)

You think this is a joke?  
**Run it and find out.**

----------

## **COMPATIBILITY**

💀 **Windows?** It "works," but don’t expect it to behave.  
💀 **Linux?** Good luck, buddy.  
💀 **Mac?** Nah. **Don’t even try.**

----------

## **INSTALLATION (LOL, GOOD LUCK)**

So you actually wanna run this? Damn. Alright:

1️⃣ **Clone the repo.** (If you don’t know how, **go learn Git first, noob.**)  
2️⃣ **Open your compiler and PRAY.**  
3️⃣ ???  
4️⃣ **Question your life choices.**

There are **no build instructions,** no dependencies listed, no CMake, no `.sln`, nothing.  
You think **I’m gonna make this easy?** Lmao. **Suffer.**

## **FAQ (You’ll Regret Asking These)**

🔹 **Q: Why does this exist?**  
**A:** **Because pain is funny.**

🔹 **Q: Can I make my own tracks with it?**  
**A:** **Yes, but why the fuck would you?**

🔹 **Q: Is it stable?**  
**A:** **No. This code is held together by spite.**

🔹 **Q: Can I uninstall it?**  
**A:** **Sure, but it's already in your registry. Good luck.**

🔹 **Q: Will this project ever be optimized?**  
**A:** **Hell no. If it runs too well, it loses its soul.**

## **LICENSE (LMFAO, WHAT LICENSE?)**

License? **Who cares.**  
If it works, it works. If it doesn’t, **skill issue.**

----------

## **FINAL WORDS**

If you’ve made it this far, **you’re either insane, curious, or both.** Either way, you’ll regret **ever laying eyes on this project.**

**May your speakers survive.**  
**Penis-PG takes no prisoners.**

💀 **Good luck.** 💀
