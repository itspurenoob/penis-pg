**"If you're here, you either love pain or made a terrible mistake."**

### What is this?

This is **NOT optimized.** This is **NOT efficient.** This is **suffering disguised as code.**  
Itâ€™s a project that runs because **God** or some cosmic glitch allows it.

### Compatibility

-   **Windows?** Youâ€™re lucky Iâ€™m feeling generous.
-   **Linux?** Lmao, compile it yourself.
-   **Mac?** Donâ€™t even try.

### Installation

You wanna run this? Oh, youâ€™re brave. Follow these steps **(or suffer trying):**

1.  Clone the repo. If you donâ€™t know how, **go learn Git first.**
2.  Open your **fancy** compiler and pray it doesnâ€™t spit out errors.
3.  ???
4.  **Question your life choices.**

### License

License? **Who cares.** If it works, it works. If it doesnâ€™t, **thatâ€™s a skill issue.**
